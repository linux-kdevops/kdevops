config WORKFLOW_DATA_DEVICE_ENABLE_CUSTOM
	bool "Enable custom device to use to create the workflow data parition"
	help
	  Enable this if you want to override the default data device.
	  Typically we have enough heuristics with kconfig to get this right
	  for you.

	  Workflows require data to be passed onto each target host. When doing
	  development or testing on target workflows you often want to keep
	  around the data so you can reinstall the OS on a target host without
	  loosing your workflow data. To help with this, workflow data is
	  stored in a parition specifally designed to outlive the Operating
	  System install. This lets you easily re-OS a system and keep the
	  data workflow around.

	  This option lets you specify the device name to use to create the
	  workflow data partition used. The type of data placed on this
	  partition conists of git trees cloned, for example the Linux kernel
	  sources if you are developing on Linux, or the fstests git tree if
	  you are testing fstests. Additionally configuration data used for
	  your target workflows.

config WORKFLOW_INFER_USER_AND_GROUP
	bool "Infer user and group to use for the workflow data partition"
	default y
	help
	  We place all target workflow data on a partition we create. We
	  typically set the username and group ownership of that partition
	  based on passed manual settings. Providing a good guess as defaults
	  through kconfig about what the target user and group should be for the
	  data partition for systems created with libvirt is easy, but this is
	  not as easy when users are using Terraform or bare metal. Instead of
	  extending the possible sensible defaults for the target username and
	  group to use for the data partition based the mechanism used for
	  bringup or Linux distribution chosen, we also provide support to infer
	  your target username and group settings based on the login user on the
	  target system.

	  You can safely enable this feature so we can do this inference. This
	  helps not have to extend our defaults for a manual settings when
	  users are using Terraform.

	  Manual setting for the group to chgrp the data workflow path.

	  We rely
	  on the the assumption your distribution has the "users" group created
	  for distributions where we are certain of that. If on debian based
	  systems we assume the same group exists with the username you used
	  to log in.

	  This mechanism if not ideal for supporting all systems and so simply
	  user the workflow user and group inference mechansim to support more
	  distributions or images, and don't extend the defaults we provide for
	  WORKFLOW_DATA_USER and WORKLOAD_DATA_GROUP.
