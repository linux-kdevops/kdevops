# Configuration for declared hosts that skip bringup process

config KDEVOPS_USE_DECLARED_HOSTS
	bool "Use declared hosts (skip bringup process)"
	select WORKFLOW_INFER_USER_AND_GROUP
	output yaml
	help
	  Enable this option to use pre-existing hosts that you have already
	  configured with SSH access. This is useful for:

	  * Bare metal systems
	  * Pre-provisioned VMs or cloud instances
	  * Systems managed by other infrastructure tools

	  When this option is enabled:
	  - SSH keys will not be generated (assumes you already have access)
	  - Bringup and teardown operations will be skipped
	  - User and group settings will be inferred from the target hosts
	  - You must provide the list of hosts in KDEVOPS_DECLARED_HOSTS

	  This option automatically:
	  - Selects WORKFLOW_INFER_USER_AND_GROUP to detect the correct
	    user and group on the target systems
	  - Assumes SSH access is already configured

config KDEVOPS_DECLARED_HOSTS
	string "List of declared hosts"
	output yaml
	default "$(shell, echo ${DECLARED_HOSTS})"
	default ""
	help
	  Provide a list of hostnames or IP addresses for the pre-existing
	  systems you want to use. These hosts must already be accessible
	  via SSH with the appropriate keys configured.

	  Format: Space or comma-separated list
	  Example: "host1 host2 host3" or "host1,host2,host3"

	  These hosts will be used directly without any bringup process.
	  Make sure you have:
	  - SSH access configured
	  - Required packages installed
	  - Appropriate user permissions

config KDEVOPS_DECLARED_HOSTS_GROUP_VARS
	bool "Apply group variables to declared hosts"
	default y
	output yaml
	help
	  When enabled, kdevops will apply the appropriate group variables
	  to the declared hosts based on the selected workflow.

	  This ensures that declared hosts receive the same configuration
	  variables as dynamically provisioned hosts would.
