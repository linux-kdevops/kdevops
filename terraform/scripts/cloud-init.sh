# oscheck kdevops cloud-init script.
#
# This script accepts the following variables set and passed:
#
# user_data_log_dir
# user_data_enabled
#
# new_hostname
#
# Note: terraform passed variables must be in the form: dollar{variable},
# where dollar is $ and provides an implicit restriction on bash variables to
# not use this same form for bash variables *not* coming from terraform. This
# restriction applies even to bash comments such as this one. Terraform
# processes these variables prior to giving the file to the host. We cannot
# use this form of variables for user_data scripts then. Or another way to
# say it, terraform implicates restrictions on user_data bash scripts to
# only one way to use bash variables because of how it processes its own
# variables.
#
# Note 2: "let" returns non-zero if the argument passed is 0, use "let" to
# increment variables with care in your bash scripts if using "set -e"
