# Azure VM Family Metadata
#
# This file contains human-readable descriptions and metadata for Azure VM
# size families to support hierarchical Kconfig menu generation.
#
# Purpose:
#   The gen_kconfig_size script uses this metadata to generate a two-layer
#   Kconfig menu: first select a VM family, then select a specific size
#   within that family.
#
# Canonical Sources:
#   https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/overview
#   (Official Azure VM sizes documentation)

#
# Format:
#   family-prefix:
#     description: "Short one-line description"
#     help_text: "Detailed multi-line help text describing use cases"
#     workloads:
#       - "Example workload 1"
#       - "Example workload 2"
#
# Family Naming Convention:
#   Azure VM families are identified by the prefix pattern in VM size names.
#   For example:
#   - Standard_D2s_v3 → Standard_D family
#   - Standard_E16_v4 → Standard_E family
#   - Standard_F8s_v2 → Standard_F family
#
# How to update this file:
# -----------------------
# When Azure introduces new VM families or you need to update descriptions:
#
# 1. Check which families are discovered by the API:
#    $ cd terraform/azure/scripts
#    $ ./gen_kconfig_size --families
#
# 2. Verify family details in Azure documentation:
#    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/overview
#
# 3. Add or update the family entry following the format above.
#
# 4. Update the "Last Updated" date above.
#
# 5. Test that families render correctly:
#    $ ./gen_kconfig_size > /tmp/Kconfig.size.test 2>&1
#    $ python3 ../../../scripts/detect_indentation_issues.py /tmp/Kconfig.size.test
#
# 6. Regenerate Kconfig.size:
#    $ ./gen_kconfig_size > ../kconfigs/Kconfig.size.generated
#
