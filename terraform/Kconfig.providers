config TERRAFORM_GCE
	bool "GCE - Google Cloud Engine"
	depends on TARGET_ARCH_X86_64
	help
	  Enabling this means you are going to use GCE for your cloud solution.

config TERRAFORM_AWS
	bool "AWS - Amazon Web Services"
	depends on TARGET_ARCH_X86_64 || TARGET_ARCH_ARM64
	help
	  Enabling this means you are going to use AWS for your cloud solution.

config TERRAFORM_AZURE
	bool "Azure"
	depends on TARGET_ARCH_X86_64
	select TERRAFORM_PRIVATE_NET
	help
	  Enabling this means you are going to use Azure for your cloud
	  solution. Note that Azure requires a private network for the
	  guests.

config TERRAFORM_OCI
	bool "OCI - Oracle Cloud Infrastructure"
	depends on TARGET_ARCH_X86_64
	help
	  Enabling this means you are going to use OCI for your cloud

config TERRAFORM_LAMBDALABS

	depends on TARGET_ARCH_X86_64
	help
	  Enabling this means you are going to use Lambda Labs for your cloud
	  solution. Lambda Labs provides GPU-accelerated instances optimized
	  for machine learning and high-performance computing workloads.

config TERRAFORM_RCLOUD
	bool "rcloud - Local Private Cloud"
	help
	  Enabling this means you are going to use rcloud as your cloud
	  solution. rcloud is a local private cloud that provides a REST API
	  for VM management through libvirt, similar to public cloud providers.

	  This requires a running rcloud server (see defconfig-rcloud).
	  Users can then provision VMs through the rcloud API using the
	  standard Terraform workflow, treating rcloud as a local cloud provider.
