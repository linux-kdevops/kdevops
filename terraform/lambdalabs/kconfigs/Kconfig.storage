# Lambda Labs storage configuration
#
# NOTE: The Lambda Labs terraform provider (elct9620/lambdalabs v0.3.0) does NOT support
# storage volume management. Instances come with their default storage only.
#
# If you need additional storage, you must:
# 1. Use the Lambda Labs web console to attach volumes manually
# 2. Or use a different cloud provider that supports storage management
#
# This file is kept as a placeholder for future provider updates.

# No configuration options available - provider doesn't support storage management
