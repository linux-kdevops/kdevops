# Lambda Labs OS images configuration

# NOTE: The Lambda Labs terraform provider (elct9620/lambdalabs v0.3.0) does NOT support
# OS image selection. Lambda Labs automatically deploys Ubuntu 22.04 LTS by default.
#
# The provider only supports these attributes for instances:
# - name (instance name)
# - region_name (deployment region)
# - instance_type_name (GPU type)
# - ssh_key_names (SSH keys)
#
# What's NOT supported:
# - OS/distribution selection
# - Custom user creation
# - User data/cloud-init scripts
# - Storage configuration
#
# SSH User: Always "ubuntu" (the OS default user)
#
# This file is kept as a placeholder for future provider updates.

# No configuration options available - provider doesn't support OS selection
