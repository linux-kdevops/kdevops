devconfig
==========

The devconfig role lets you customize your shell environment on target systems
with your typical set of user preferences. For example if you have a
~/.gitconfig file it will copy it over to each target system you run ansible
on. Likewise you may have a set of favorite bash hacks, which you are used to.
You can stuff these into your file ~/.enhance-bash and devconfig will ensure
that each target system sources this file on their .bashrc file on both the
default target user and also root.

All these are optional. The file copies and modifications only happen if the
files exist.
